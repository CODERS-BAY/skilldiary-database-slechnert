# Test

The test was nice, enough time, straightforward examples, overall good.

It being written in german had all of us answer in german tho, including ERDs which should have been written in english.
The task to translate shit in english and do the work again, defeats the purpose of showing how much of the actual subject was understood and can be applied.

In addition to other mischievious games and tests of power, I waste no thought on following through on such BS orders.
