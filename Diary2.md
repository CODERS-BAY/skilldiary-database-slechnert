# YASSSS, FINALLY SOME THEORY!

## Anomalies
There are 3 anomalies and 3 forms to norm / standardize databases / relationtypes.<br>
The 3 anomalies are:
* Insert an.
* Update an.
* Delete an.

They basically just describe the instances in which errors can occur, the normal forms are used to reduce those and redundancies.
