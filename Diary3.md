# Databases still suck

Thinking a more complex example through is nice, progress is slow but somewhat steady.<br>
Drawin the actual diagram is a fucking pain and obnoxious as hell.
Thinking shit through and playing around in a text form is nice preperation for drawing it out tho.

The absurd time limits sucks tho. 

Either way I will continue to alternate between focusing on fractions of the tasks to get better at em, and trying to get something on paper quickly to throw those together. There is a distinct difference between learning zone and performance zone, codependency included.
