# ERMs!?

Hollalooyah, who would have thought!?
Going though one's homework once, are the only minutes of the day where useful input *can happen.*<br>
**Today it was the info that a key-attribute can be primary to multiple entities and that weak entities can have multiple relations.**

Then, once again, doing an exercise alone, recieving crap talk for not structuring time as expected. Then crap wether exercise was handed in in time (would've been hard to look up for oneself), then some more crap for not doing the exercise that will result in homework either way on paper from the start, but using the time to discuss general procedure and stuff with the people around, instead of sitting there alone, like I could alone at home as well.
Yes it makes total sense. To someone. I guess.
